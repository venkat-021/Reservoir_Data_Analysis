One of the solutions for reducing the water scarcity in India

India’s power sector is dominated by thermal power generation India’s current power mix and generation is largely comprised of thermal power—coal represents 50 percent of installed capacity. This makes it highly exposed to water risk as thermal power is dependent on the uninterrupted availability of freshwater for a range of operational needs. Disruptions in power supply due to droughts have compounding effects across a range of users from industry to agriculture to human health. In areas with high water stress, having access to timely information on water availability could help decision-makers avoid the risk of acute water-driven power outages and advocate for long-term, water-prudent policies and management. 

On average, the 11 pilot reservoirs in this study achieved and analyzed the data from the past year. This makes the decision-makers  make decisions easier as to how much water is utilized for power generation and when the water level in the reservoir  is low and make their decisions accordingly. 

Enormous volumes of India’s thermoelectric-heavy power production—up to 14 terawatt-hours of electricity generation during the 2016 drought.
Our pilot project provides open access to near-real-time alerts of potential water shortages for 11 reservoirs in India, all of which source water for thermal coal power generation.
